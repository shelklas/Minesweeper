# Minesweeper
A simple recreation of the classical game minesweeper. The object of the game is to flag of the mines, using logic to 
deduce what tiles are mines, and what tiles are empty. This is done by clicking on a tile to reveal what is under it,
if it is a blank spot and near a mine, the tile will display how many mines are nearby. 
If you click on a tile that is a mine, you lose. Have fun!
